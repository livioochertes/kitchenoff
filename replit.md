## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform features a modern React frontend with Radix UI components styled with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a professional and consistent user experience. Design elements include glassmorphism, gradient backgrounds, and organized layouts with consistent button placements (e.g., Cancel on left, Action on right in modals). Multilingual support is extensive, covering 11 languages with RTL support for Arabic, and includes a dynamic currency system that displays prices in "lei" for RON currency. The admin interface is streamlined with professional layouts, consistent icon and text organization, and features like drag-and-drop for category positioning and visual indicators.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite, Wouter for routing, React Hook Form with Zod for validation, and TanStack Query for server state management.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, TypeScript, and ES modules. Authentication is JWT-based with bcrypt for password hashing and includes Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon serverless) managed with Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations.
- **Performance**: Optimized for sub-millisecond API responses by loading all data into in-memory storage at startup, with server-side pre-warming and cache-busting.
- **Core Features**:
    - **Product Logistics**: Comprehensive logistics fields (weight, dimensions, pieces per package) integrated from Excel imports to multi-parcel AWB generation, ensuring parcel company compliance.
    - **Order Management**: Full order lifecycle management (Pending, Processing, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled) with automated status updates, email notifications, and detailed tracking.
    - **Invoicing**: Smartbill API integration for automated invoice generation with Romanian tax compliance (RON, 19% VAT), sequential numbering, and local fallback.
    - **Shipping**: Sameday Courier API integration for AWB generation with smart fallback to manual AWB system, and configurable shipping settings with currency awareness.
    - **Checkout Flow**: Intelligent, streamlined checkout for authenticated users with pre-filled data (2-steps) and full 3-step for guests. Supports Cash on Delivery and various online payment methods.
    - **Admin Panel**: Extensive CRUD operations for products, categories, users, orders, and suppliers. Includes bulk operations, product analytics, and a comprehensive Excel import system for product data.
    - **AI Assistant**: ChatGPT-powered multilingual AI assistant with session and chat history persistence, capable of providing product information and order support.
    - **Image Management**: Comprehensive image upload system with multiple images per product, drag-and-drop, Sharp image processing (WebP conversion, thumbnails), and main image designation.

### System Design Choices
- **Monorepo Structure**: Shared schema definitions between frontend and backend ensure type safety across the entire stack.
- **Modularity**: Location data is modular for easy expansion and maintenance of country, county, and city dropdowns.
- **Caching**: Aggressive caching strategy with in-memory data storage, server-side pre-warming, and cache-busting ensures high performance and data freshness.
- **Localization**: System design inherently supports internationalization with dynamic currency handling, multilingual content, and region-specific features (e.g., Romanian tax compliance).
